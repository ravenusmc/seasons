## Intro

This is a very simple web project that is the first one that I will be doing to get back into using Node and 
Express. I will use React to build the entire site. From here, I will continue to build more complex websites with Node and Express.

1. Clone the repo
2. Run npm install

### Technology Stack

1. Express
2. Node
3. React 

### Operation
  
Follow the directions under installing. 

# Issues
  
Not really an issue but I used the React CDN's instead of installing them with bower.
